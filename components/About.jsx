        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a Stanford student studying Symbolic Systems with a concentration in HCI, passionate about building thoughtful products at the intersection of creativity, technology, and storytelling. I hope to grow deeper in product strategy and development, especially in spaces where content, community, and creativity, like film, digital creation, and emerging media. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and moved to the U.S. at 15. I started experimenting with content when I was 9 (posting my first YouTube video long before I knew it counted), and officially began my social media journey at 12. Since then, storytelling, whether through video, design, or product!

          Outside of school, I love working on creative side projects. I’ve built design-driven small businesses like Jenny Slimey, a slime shop I launched when I was 12, and Whoop, a clothing brand where I hand-illustrated each graphic piece. I also have a soft spot for visual branding and world-building, and I bring that into everything I make. When I’m not working on product or creative projects, you’ll probably find me hanging out with my bunny Bambi, rewatching Disney movies, or planning another Disneyland trip (I genuinely wanted to be a Disney animator growing up).
